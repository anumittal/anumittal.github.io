<div dir="ltr"  trbidi="on">I have successfully generated CMake Configuration and have added the code to the kde review board (https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/121758/) , corrections asked were made accordingly. Now finally the main task is to port all .cpp files, which i have been working on for a while.<br /><div>Initially got stuck at few places and also had my university examination going on due to which there was a fall in my contribution but now as i am through all these, it's time to gear up the application porting task under the guidance of my mentor.<br /><div>Hoping for a good luck.</div></div></div>
