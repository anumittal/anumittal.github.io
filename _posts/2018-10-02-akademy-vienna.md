This year Akademy (an annual world summit of KDE) was held in a beautiful city Vienna, Europe during the late second and third week of August.

Akademy like every year had many interesting talks and bofs scheduled

My talk was scheduled on the first day of the event where I talked on Kontainerzing KDE.

The talk began with a general introduction to Containerization technologies and why we need it. Followed by how we have used Docker and flatpak at KDE.

The presentation is available [here][presentation]

It was a great experience to meet active contributor of KDE all around the globe and learn more about the insights. During the KDE India bof, we discussed how we can get more contributors on board and get the most out of conf.kde.in 2019.

Looking forward to seeing more contributors in India in the conf.kde.in next year.
