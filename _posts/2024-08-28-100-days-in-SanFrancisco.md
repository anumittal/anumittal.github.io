# 100 Days in San Francisco
<img src="/assets/images/MovingToSF/GoldenGate.webp" alt="Campus" width="100%"/>

**5 years [later](/60-days-in-Singapore), I shifted to San Francisco, CA in May 2024. So, here is how my ~100 days in SF looks like.**

The **first week** was mostly about getting accustomed to the commute system and routes here, apart from understanding and learning more about the company you are part of.

## Transportation
Muni, BART, CalTrain, buses, and cabs (Waymo, Uber, Lyft, and traditional taxis).

**Tickets:**
- If you are an iPhone user, for local transport (Muni and buses), you can get a Clipper card in your Wallet app or from any of the Muni, BART, or CalTrain stations and top-up the card whenever needed.
- One alternative is setting up Apple Pay or Google Pay. You can also use your debit card for the same.
- If none of these work for you, you can also buy tickets from the bus driver or Muni/BART/CalTrain ticket counters each time.

**Cost:**
Muni, BART, CalTrain/buses are the cheapest means of transportation (ranging from $2.50 to $10 depending on the distance). Cabs can be quite costly (average $10 to $20). Uber and Lyft prices vary, especially during peak hours or late at night. Traditional taxis might be a better option during surge pricing times.

**The best app to navigate:** CityMapper (honestly, I find it better than Google Maps’ navigation feature).

The **second week** is mostly the settling week.

## A Place to Stay
There are multiple apps to help you find a place to stay, like Zillow, Apartments.com, or Craigslist.
You can also join Facebook groups like “San Francisco Housing, Rooms, Apartments, Sublets” for good deals.

You can either rent a 1-bedroom apartment or rent a room in a shared apartment. There are two main types of housing options:
* **Apartments** - Traditional apartment complexes or high-rises.
* **Condominiums (Condos)** - Often come with facilities like swimming pools and gyms.

Renting a 1-bedroom in a condo in popular areas like SoMa or Mission Bay will cost around $3,000 to $4,000 or more per month depending on the location. Shared apartments or rooms in a shared house can range from $1,500 to $2,500 monthly.

## SIM Card and Bank Account

**Recommended options for SIM:**
  - **AT&T:** ~ $30 to $60 monthly.
  - **T-Mobile:** ~ $25 to $50 monthly (with more/unlimited data offers).

**Popular bank options:**
  - **Wells Fargo** - Everyday Checking Account.
  - **Chase Bank** - Chase Total Checking Account.

You need an address proof for both to get a SIM card (postpaid) and to create a new bank account. You can get a *prepaid SIM* card from the airport or any mobile store.

## Food
We usually either order food online or go out nearby to the office to have lunch during weekdays.

There are two types of dining places:
* **Restaurants:** Depending on the area, say, North Beach, the Marina, or the Mission District, the cost will be $20 to $40 for a complete meal. Restaurants in less touristy areas can offer meals from $15 to $30.
* **Food Trucks:** San Francisco is famous for its diverse and vibrant food truck scene, where you can find a meal for $10 to $20.

## Food Ordering Apps
- **DoorDash**
- **UberEats**

Ordering food online via any of these apps, the average cost per meal per person will range from $10 (for fast food) to $25 (for a proper meal). You can buy free delivery subscriptions in the DoorDash app if you plan to order food often.

## Pharmacy
- **CVS**
- **Walgreens**
- **Rite Aid**

## Supermarkets & Convenience Stores
- **Trader Joe's**
- **Whole Foods**
- **Gus's Community Market**
- **Costco** (for bulk shopping)
- **Safeway**
- **7-Eleven** (Open 24 hours - Most of the stores)

For those missing home or craving Indian groceries, **Little India in Berkeley** is worth a visit. You can find many Indian grocery stores and restaurants in the area.

## Touristy Places I Have Explored So Far
Golden Gate Park, Napa Valley, a Baseball match at Oracle Park Stadium, Headlands View Point, Mission District, Ferry Building, Mission Creek Park, Pier 39, Fisherman’s Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Stay tuned. :)
