I am Anu Mittal, a **Software Developer** in an Indian company, [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/ncr). I completed my bachelors in computer science in 2016. A FOSS enthusiast, I started its journey in 2014 with [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) involved in programs like Season of KDE '14 and Google Summer of Code '16 as a student developer.
I've also been a speaker at various tech conferences sharing my experiences and work in both open source and KDE.

When not at work, you can find me: traveling, clicking pictures, dancing or sleeping :D
